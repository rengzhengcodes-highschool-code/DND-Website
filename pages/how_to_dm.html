			<h2 class="heading">How to be a DM</h2>
				<p class="body">
					&emsp; The DM, short for Dungeon Master (Game Master in other RPGs), 
					creates the world and facilitates gameplay among the players. 
					If you are reading this article, you are likely a novice DM, 
					and thus we shall first start at the beginning. We will expect 
					that you know a bit about the rules already (if you don’t there’s 
					a button above that will direct you to another article on our site) 
					and some terminology.
				</p>
			<h2 class="heading">How to Start a Campaign</h2>
				<p class="body">
					&emsp; The first step in starting a campaign, of course, is finding players. 
					These can be anyone you would normally hang out with classmates, friends, 
					or people at the local game store. Anyone can be a player! As a DM, 
					it is important to choose players who get along with everyone in the group. 
					A bad campaign starts with a poor party (group of players) who you do not 
					get along with and/or do not get along with each other.
				</p>
				<h3 class="heading">Managing Expectations</h3>
					<p class="body">
						&emsp; Once you have chosen a party with which you would like to play D&D, 
						you must then set up expectations. This is very important in a campaign, 
						if the expectations in a campaign do not match, it will be no fun for all. 
						To do this, ask everyone to come to the table with what they expect from the campaign. 
						Do they want adventure? Political intrigue? Exploration? Something else? Do they want 
						high magic? Steampunk? Low magic? Questions like these about the world and gameplay 
						must be answered before the campaign begins.
					</p>
					<h4 class="heading">Session 0</h4>
						<p class="body">
							&emsp; A very common way of doing this is what’s commonly called a “session 0.” 
							This is a session held before anything in the campaign has been formalized: 
							no details of the world or adventure are concrete, the players likely don’t 
							have characters yet, et cetera. Here, the only purpose of the campaign is to 
							set out rules of engagement, defining which activities are off-limits, what 
							the adventure will be like, et cetera.
							<br>
							&emsp; If your party has already done the above, session 0 also is commonly used 
							to brief players about the world, getting them immersed, and checking character 
							sheets to make sure they match the theme of the world. It also is an opportunity 
							for the DM to get any last-minute feedback from their players and answer questions 
							about rules, the world, and other questions involving either the mechanics or the 
							roleplaying element.
						</p>
				<h3 class="heading">World-Building</h3>
					<p class="body">
						&emsp; Taking the feedback you learned from “Managing Expectations” and now craft a world and plot around this. 
						First it helpful to create a world. Where do the players start? Who are important figures (or NPCs 
						(non-playable characters)) the players might encounter? What will their missions be? Usually, you 
						don’t have to flesh out every single detail in the world and it is perfectly fine to have many blank 
						spaces that will get filled in later—improv is an enormous part of DMing. However, having a rough outline 
						of what the world looks like and where the story should roughly go is an excellent DMing tool to aid in the 
						game's immersion as you have something coherent to build off of and maintain world continuity.
						<br>
						&emsp; If you do plan something in-depth, don’t be surprised if the players somehow miss it, despite being painfully 
						obvious. Murphy’s law is always in play, anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Don’t force your players into a path, 
						that’s railroading and makes the game dull for everyone. However, do keep the plans somewhere close by. It is perfectly 
						acceptable to re-skin plot elements and reuse them later—the players won’t know, they haven’t been through it! 
						<br>
						&emsp; Remember during all this to keep matching the expectations of the players while keeping it fun for yourself. D&D is a 
						cooperative game meant to be fun for everyone and there’s a common saying “no D&D is better than bad D&D.”
					</p>
				<h3 class="heading">Running a Game</h3>
					<p class="body">
						&emsp; Great! Now you have a world, players with characters (check out our character creation guide here), and are ready to begin! 
						First is the most obvious but is often a stumbling block for many campaigns. You need to set a good meeting place that works for 
						everyone and find session times work for everyone. If not enough people show up, it’s simply not fun and sometimes the plot moves so 
						quickly that you end up leaving players behind, which isn’t fun for them and neither to you if you’re anyway close to them. Thus, to 
						keep the game fun and happening on a regular basis (this is important to prevent the campaign from silently falling apart) be sure to 
						set times where people can meet. 
						<br>
						&emsp; However, if you cannot do this, it’s perfectly fine! As long as players are still engaged with the campaign, playing when you 
						can at random times still can make a lively campaign! Just make sure that everyone is truly free, as sometimes people cancel last 
						minute due to preexisting commitments they forgot about. Given these long session breaks, the next part becomes especially important.
					</p>
					<h4 class="heading">Session Notes</h4>
						<p class="body">
							&emsp; Session notes are a DM’s way of keeping track of what happens in the fantasy world of the campaign. It helps you remember what 
							happens in case there’s a long break between sessions. It also helps you organize your thoughts and remember what that 
							overarching plot you planned out months ago was. Keeping good session notes is a way to help your future self write coherent, 
							good plots that remain self-consistent and immersive. Session notes should contain plans for where the campaign will be going 
							in the future, what the plan for the next session is, and what has already happened in the session. It’s ok to outsource this 
							last part to the players too. After all, you have unlimited fantasy resources to give.
						</p>
					<h4 class="heading">Improv</h4>
						<p class="body">
							&emsp; The core of DMing is improv. What’s not in your notes or what’s not in the rulebooks you must decide on the spot, no dilly 
							dallying. You need to always be quick on your feet, ready to respond to any actions the characters take. The best improv 
							doesn’t come from pre-planning every single scenario but rather quick on-the-spot thinking. You can’t plan for every scenario 
							so instead embrace the chaos and relish in the turmoil. It’s important to record what happens in the improv too because they’re 
							often the most entertaining and also important parts of the campaign.
						</p>
					<h4 class="heading">Building Encounters</h4>
						<p class="body">
							&emsp; Encounters can range from anything from combat to diplomacy to exploration. Either way, you should always have a good plan on what 
							happens in an encounter. A battle isn’t fun if it’s four people against one rat, diplomacy isn’t fun if the guy just agrees with 
							all your demands, and exploration isn’t fun if they keep discovering the same type of tree over and over. Thus you need to plan 
							something eventful in the encounter, memorable, exciting, and also story consistent and consistent with player expectations. It’s 
							also important to note what the setting is. You can do this by preparing a short description in your session notes, creating a 
							combat map, or simply freestyling it (this one is the least labor-intensive but also requires the most concentration).
							<br>
							&emsp; If your encounter requires NPCs or enemies, please remember to note them down somewhere. If they’re enemies, create stat blocks 
							that closely resemble that of a character sheet: noting their ability scores, spells, weapons, skills, et cetera. You can also use 
							pre-made enemies, as found in the Monster Manual and other D&D books, which is perfectly fine. If they’re NPCs but passive, it also 
							is sometimes useful to have at least a vague idea of their combat ability you can improv on the spot as sometimes a situation might 
							sour and combat begins. You also must have a rough idea of how each NPC will act so the story stays fun and you don’t confuse your 
							players when an NPC takes illogical actions because you forgot how they were. When combining all these things, a coherent setting, a 
							coherent plan, and coherent NPCs, you can create a great encounter.
						</p>
					<h4 class="heading">Chance</h4>
						<p class="body">
							&emsp; Chance is a large part of D&D. The nature of dice is always random, which keeps the game exciting by allowing unlikely upsets, 
							clutch victories, and heroic “one second before doom” saves. Thus, always be prepared for these upsets and, more importantly, don’t try 
							to fight against it. It’s a part of the game that keeps it fun, if you don’t have chance you’re simply writing a story, not playing an 
							RPG. Thus, plan for chance.
							<br>
							&emsp; Of course, there are scenarios where you might not want chance to play a role. For example, sometimes an NPC is simply too 
							powerful to be beaten by the best the players can muster, and thus in that scenario, it’s perfectly acceptable not to allow chance 
							to be a factor. However, please be careful with your use of this privilege, it's a very exclusive DM tool. Too much abuse of it 
							railroads your players and makes the game dull and boring.
						</p>
					<h4 class="heading">Conflict</h4>
						<p class="body">
							&emsp; The last thing we will take about in this guide will be managing conflict. Sooner or later in your D&D campaign, you or your 
							players will face real-life conflict. Maybe a player is cheating, maybe you guys can’t meet often, maybe they simply don’t 
							find the campaign fun anymore. If this happens, these are the steps you should take to mediate this.
							<ol class="body">
								<li>Try to mediate it when it occurs. If it’s a minor issue like a rules dispute, hear the player out and let them try 
									to convince you why their interpretation is correct. Usually, if you’re both diplomatic and reasonable, you should 
									come to an agreement relatively quickly.</li>
								<li>End the session. If the conflict is not resolved within 15 to 30 minutes, end the session. Tempers are getting high 
									and the session is going nowhere. It ruins the experience for all. Ending the session might end the fun for the night, 
									but it preserves future fun by maintaining good relations in the campaign.</li>
								<li>Settle it out of session. Talk to the affected parties and try to remediate a solution. Do not resume the campaign until 
									this is resolved. If you simply cannot resolve it, there are two remaining options you can take.
									<ul>
										<li>Kick out the problem players. That’s it. Just kick them out. You don’t owe your time to anybody. 
											If this ends the campaign, so be it, no D&D is better than bad D&D.</li>
										<li>Rubber room them. If for some reason you cannot kick them out, rubber room them. Agree with what they say 
											and simply make sure their actions don’t have overarching consequences or affect anyone else’s quality of play. 
											Eventually, they’ll get the message and either leave of their own volition or reform. Either way is a win for you.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ol>

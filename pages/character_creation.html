                So you want to make a character? It’s actually pretty simple, but might take a little while to do. There are three main steps that you have to do in order to make a character, and they will be found in greater detail on this page.

                    The first step is coming up with a backstory. Now this backstory can really be anything you want. Is your character a knight seeking vengeance after their family was captured by orcs? Is your character a servant of their god on a quest to purify the heretics? Is your character propelled by a burning hatred of taxation? As long as your DM (Dungeon Master) is ok with your backstory and it fits into your setting, it can really be anything.
                </p>
                <p class="body">
                    Some other things to keep in mind is that during your backstory creation you should also pick a race for your character. Most of the time your DM will say what source material is ok to use, so be sure to check with them what races are available to pick within your campaign. One last thing to do is pick a background. Backgrounds are provided in most source books, so check with your DM which ones you will be using. Backgrounds do many useful things such as giving your character items, proficiency in certain things (which will be discussed soon) and other useful things.

                    The second is deciding your class. There are quite a few classes within D&D, but for this we’ll be using a cleric as an example. Oftentimes your class will have something to do with your backstory. Say your character is a thief, well then they’d be a rogue. If they’re a knight then they’re probably a fighter, but picking a class is not the only thing that matters when picking a class.
                </p>
                <p class="body">
                    All of the classes have subclasses within them. These subclasses may be called many different things depending on the class. Going back to our cleric example, these subclasses are called domains. Each subclass grants features that help to make that class more effective in their specific niche, both in and out of combat. Let’s take a life domain cleric as an example. A life domain cleric’s main goals are something along the lines of healing the sick, driving away the undead and otherwise maintaining good in the universe. As such they have access to more healing spells than a normal cleric as well as making those healing spells more effective. Most classes and subclasses have a certain idea or theme, so be sure to try and match that with your character’s backstory.
                </p>
                <p class="body">
                    Another important thing is that your class determines things such as proficiency and how much health you have. Proficiency is how skilled you are at using something or doing something. If you have proficiency in an action or a weapon that will allow you to add your proficiency bonus (which can be found on your classes’ table) to those kinds of checks/attacks. Proficiency in armor negates some negative effects. If you don’t have proficiency in the type of armor you are wearing, you have disadvantage on any ability checks, saving throws or attacks that use Dexterity or Strength, as well as being unable to cast spells.

                <p class="body">
                    Your class also determines how much health you have. Take the cleric as an example. A cleric’s hit dice are d8s, but what does that mean? This means that at 1st level a cleric has 8 + their constitution modifier (we’ll cover that soon) health. Every time they level up they can roll a d8, or use the number 5, plus their constitution modifier and add that to their total health. Other classes use different dice, but the principle is the same except it’s a different die that you roll.

                    Step Three

                    The third is rolling for stats as well as starting gear. Your class and background will determine what kind of starting items you have, so make sure to take note of those. Some campaigns will also have the characters start with extra, or less gear so be sure to check with your dm if that is the case with your campaign. Now the last thing is rolling for stats. D&D has 6 stats, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. There are also a bunch of skills attached to each stat, but unless you have proficiency in them your modifier for each is the same as your skill.
                </p>
                <p class="body">
                    So how do you determine your modifier? Well the first thing you need to do is roll for your stat score. You do this by rolling 4d6, and keeping the highest 3. You do this 6 times and can assign any of the totals to any skill that you want. Keep in mind that each class has different stats that they use, so be sure to assign your higher scores to that one stat. Another safe stat to assign high scores to is Constitution as it impacts how much health you have.
                </p>
                <p class="body">
                    Now that you have your ability scores, you can figure out your modifiers. If your score is below 10 then it will be negative while if it is above 11 it will be positive. If it is 10 or 11, your modifier is 0. If your score is 8, 9, 12 or 13 then your modifier is 1. If your score is 6, 7, 14 or 15 your modifier is 2. If your score is 4, 5, 16 or 17 your modifier is 3. If your score is 2, 3, 18 or 19 then your modifier is 4. If your score is 1 or 20 your modifier is 5. Remember if it is negative or positive as that will be very important.
                </p>
                <p class="body">
                    Now that's pretty much it. If you follow these steps correctly your character should be all ready.

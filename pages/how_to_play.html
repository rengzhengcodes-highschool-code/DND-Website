				Introduction to Dungeons and Dragons, and How to Play
			</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
			<p>Welcome to your intro to dungeons and dragons!</p>
			<p>Dungeons and Dragons is a TTRPG - a TableTop RolePlaying Game. It is known as D&D or just dnd for short. The point of the game is to gather around with your friends and go on epic quests, gather loot, create stories, and have fun.</p>
			<p>If you want to play Dungeons and Dragons, this page contains the basic rules.</p>
			<p>In the game there is a player called the Dungeon Master. This player runs the game for the rest. They act as all the Non-Player Characters (NPCs), all the villains, and they determine everything that happens as a result of the player’s actions. Essentially the game world, also known as the setting, is under their control. The rest of the players each have their own character, which they use to play the game.</p>
			<p>Each character has six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. For those who don’t know that constitution can also be used to talk about one’s health and fortitude. These six ability scores determine everything that you can do, from persuading a merchant to give you a better deal, to doing a leap across a chasm. Within each ability score are subdivisions called skills, which are essentially specializations. For example if you want to persuade someone of something, rather than using charisma, you would use persuasion. If you want to leap across a chasm, you can choose either athletics or acrobatics, which rely on Strength and Dexterity respectively. Each ability score also has what’s called a saving throw; it’s used whenever your character has to use an ability to get out of danger. For example, when you are poisoned you make a Constitution saving throw because your body and health are resisting the poison. If a fireball is launched at you then you can make a Dexterity saving throw to try to dodge it. The ability scores can all be abbreviated using the first three letters: Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha.</p>
			<p>Whenever you make an ability check, skill check, or saving throw, you always roll a twenty sided die. In the game, dice are referred to with an abbreviation: AdB. A is the number of dice being rolled, and B is the number of sides on the die. So whenever you make a skill check for example, you are rolling 1d20, or just a d20 for short (you can drop the 1). You also add the appropriate modifier to it, being the ability score the check relies on, and if you are proficient you add your proficiency bonus. The d20 is the most important die there is. Most rolls you do will involve the d20; the rest of the dice are mainly there for damage rolls, but they do have some other uses.</p>
			<p>Each character has three unique choices at creation: background, race, and class. I won’t get into background and race here, as they will be explained in the create a character page, but I will elaborate on classes. Just like in a video game, there are different classes that have different abilities. For example, the barbarian has a rage ability, in which they get stronger through their anger. The paladin is a holy warrior, who smites heathens with the power of their god(s). The wizard is an intelligent person who studies arcane symbols in order to learn the spells, and can eventually gain the ability to rewrite the universe itself. </p>
			<p>All these different abilities are gained at certain levels. The barbarian gains the rage ability at level 2, which increases their damage and scales with level (meaning it gets better as you level up). They also gain more abilities, including abilities related to rage, as they level up. The paladin gains the ability to smite their foes at level 2, as well as the ability to cast weak spells. On the other hand, the wizard gains no combat bonuses, but they can cast powerful spells starting from level 1. At every level they learn new spells and gain the ability to cast more spells.</p>
			<p>Within each class is a subclass, another direction of choices. For example do you want to be a conjuration wizard, do can summon more powerful creatures, or do you want to be a divination wizard, who can predict the future? A rogue who specializes in stealing stuff, or a rogue who specializes in assassinations? It’s up to the player to decide that. Of course, they can choose any theme they want for their character, even if there are no bonuses for it. A player could choose to play a divination wizard, who sees the future and uses that to assassinate their enemies. Even though they aren’t a rogue, and therefore don’t gain the abilities of a rogue, they can still borrow from the aspects/ideas of a rogue.</p>
			<p>Dungeons and Dragons is based on combat and roleplaying. Roleplaying is talking to your DM (Dungeon Master), the person who runs the game, and acting out your character interactions with the NPCs (Non-Player Characters). For example when you are buying a sword from a merchant, the DM might first describe the merchant, then put on a British accent and talk about how he’s from a faraway land selling magical swords. You might take interest, being in need of a magic sword. But when you ask what the price is, you become unhappy. You try to negotiate the price downward, rolling a persuasion check. You only roll an 11, and your DM says the merchant isn’t impressed. However your character is a strong barbarian, covered in swords and other weapons. You lean over, tap the greatsword hanging over your shoulder, and ask the merchant if he is absolutely sure about the price. You roll a 22 on an intimidation check, and the merchant becomes scared of you. He offers you the magical sword for free, along with another sword as an apology. That’s how Roleplaying works in dnd. The player makes choices, the DM reacts to those choices, and the player reacts to the DM’s reaction. This pattern continues until that scene is over.</p>
			<p>Combat takes place in rounds. Each round every creature in the combat gets one turn. The order of turns is determined by a roll called the initiative roll. It’s a dexterity check that each creature makes at the start of combat, and the order of turns goes from highest roll to lowest. On each turn, each creature gets one action, one bonus action, one free action, and movement based on their speed. They can choose to do this in any order, or even break up their movement. For example you can move 15 ft (feet), make an attack, then run 15 ft away. Movement must be taken in intervals of 5 ft. With an action you can do many things, including: casting a spell, making an attack with a weapon, hiding, running away, helping an ally with something they try, and more. Each turn you only get one action, so you have to choose one of those things. A bonus action is not another action; things that take an action cannot be done using a bonus action. All that a bonus action can be used for is stuff that specifically says it uses a bonus action. A free action can be used to do simple things, such as open a door, pick up an item, and draw a sword from its holster.</p>
			<p>When making an attack roll, you roll a d20 and add your strength, or your dexterity if the weapon has the finesse property. You then add your proficiency modifier if you are proficient with it (which is determined by your class). That’s the number you “rolled to hit”. Each creature has an AC, an Armor Class. If you roll a number greater than or equal to their Armor Class, you successfully hit the creature. You then roll damage based on the weapon. For example a greatsword deals 2d6 damage. Add your strength (or dexterity modifier if finesse) to that and you have the total damage you dealt. </p>
			<p>When casting a spell, you must use up a spell slot of a level equivalent to or greater than the level of the spell. For example you can cast a 2nd level spell with either a 2nd or 3rd level spell slot. Usually casting it with a higher level spell slot provides added benefit, but you might want to save that 3rd level spell slot for your 3rd level spells.</p>
			<p>And that is all you need to know to start playing dungeons and dragons! If anyone in your group has played, be sure to ask them for help when playing; only the major rules have been covered here, not the more specific stuff.</p>
